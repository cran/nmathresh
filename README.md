# nmathresh

The package `nmathresh` provides functions for the calculation and presentation of decision-invariant bias adjustment thresholds and intervals for Network Meta-Analysis, as described by Phillippo et al. (2018, [doi:10.1111/rssa.12341](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rssa.12341)). These describe the smallest changes to the data that would result in a change of decision.
